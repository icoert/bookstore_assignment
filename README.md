# Book Store Application

The Bookstore Application is a web-based platform for managing a collection of books. It allows users to view a list of books, search and filter them, manage their shopping cart, and update their user profile. The application demonstrates modern React development practices, including state management with Redux Toolkit, component styling with TailwindCSS, and advanced features like testing with Jest and responsive design.
